# Network Security Assessment Using Nmap

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Nmap (Network Mapper), a crucial open-source tool for network mapping and security auditing. Nmap is essential for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity operations, allowing for the detection of operational services, scanning of networks, and uncovering of vulnerabilities. This project highlights various Nmap functionalities and their real-world applications.

## Key Objectives
- Perform network discovery and security evaluations.
- Simulate attack scenarios and uncover weaknesses.
- Explore Nmapâ€™s capabilities in detecting open ports, identifying operating systems, and assessing service vulnerabilities.

## Limitations of Nmap

1. **Detection and Evasion:** Firewalls and intrusion detection systems may identify Nmap scans, leading to alarms or blocked scans.
2. **Accuracy of OS Detection:** Nmap's OS detection may be inaccurate with custom or obscured systems, or when hindered by firewalls or proxies.
3. **Limited Web Application Testing:** Nmap may not detect complex web vulnerabilities as effectively as specialized tools like Burp Suite.
4. **Large Network Scans:** Scanning large networks may be resource-intensive, potentially causing network disruptions.
5. **Legal and Ethical Constraints:** Unauthorized scanning may be illegal or unethical, requiring proper authorization.

## Conclusion
This project underscores the importance of Nmap in network security assessments and highlights its capabilities and limitations. Proper use of Nmap can significantly enhance the security posture of various systems and networks.
